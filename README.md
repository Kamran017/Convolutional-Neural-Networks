# Convolutional-Neural-Networks

## CNN Based Classification and Transfer Learning Based Image Acces Application

In this notebook, a convolutional network design will be made on a CINIC-10 dataset. In addition, with the reclassification of VGG-16 and Resnet-50 models, which were previously trained in the Imagenet dataset, with CINIC-10, and the feature vector obtained from this model, a system that finds the most similar 5 pictures in a picture will be designed and implemented.
